					<br/>An experiment using gridviews to provide customizable music playlists.  Normal playlists must be played
					in order, randomly, or by the rules of some unknown so-called genius algorithm.  This prototype attempts to give
					listeners control over the flow of their playlists, while still retaining some randomness in the playback to
					keep playback from getting stale and predictable.<br/><br/>
					Listeners lay out the songs, artists or albums for their playlist in a grid pattern.  Once playback has commenced,
					the next song to play will be randomly chosen from adjacent playlist grids (vertically and horizontally adjacent
					grids only.  If an unplayed choice is not available adjacent to the last played song, a new grid to start from is
					randomly chosen.<br/><br/>

					<br/><br/>Current implemented features :<br/>
					<ul>
						<li>Pause and resume playback.</li>
						<li>Choose to play a single song per grid or all songs on the grid.</li>
						<li>Tap on a grid to choose it to be played next.</li>
						<li>Reset played grids so that they may be played again.</li>
						<li>Toggle individual grids between played / not-played.</li>
						<li>Settings may be changed while the grid choosing algorithm is running.</li>

					<div class="blink_me">
						<strong>It plays music !!</strong><br/>
					</div>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Added a static set of songs matching my static Grid playlist to the app and figured out basic MediaPlayer
							controls, starting and pausing music playback</li>
						<li>Added  an OnCompletion listener for the MediaPlayer to start the next song when the current one finishes</li>
						<li>Hooked up the skip-fastforward button to skip to the next song by stopping the current playback and explicitly
							calling the MedioPlayer's OnCompletion() method</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug when switching from single-play to album-play.  The album would use an old value for albumPlayIndex,
							left-over from a previous album-play setting.  I had to implement a method to get the index of a song from a grid,
							add a class variable to store the current playing song, and update albumPlayIndex when the album-play setting is chosen.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<p><br/><br/>Version 2.1 March 15, 2018<br/></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Removed rewind / fastfoward buttons for now</li>
						<li>Added stop button and implemented stop playing functionality</li>
						<li>Implemented Audio Focus
							<ul>
								<li>app grabs focus when user presses PLAY</li>
								<li>focus is kept until
									<ul>
										<li>player presses PAUSE</li>
										<li>player presses STOP</li>
										<li>player enters DONE state after playing all grids</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>music playback pauses when the app losses focus (i.e. incoming phone call)</li>
								<li>music playback continues when the app regains focus</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Highlight main menu button text when pressed</li>
						<li>Highlight settings options text when pressed.</li>
						<li>Got a code snippet working that discovers music files on the phone</li>
						<li>Added custom app icon</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<p><br/><br/>Version 2.2 March 20, 2018<br/></p>
					<ul>
						<li>App now plays songs from the phone rather than needing music resources contained within the app.  The pathnames are still
							hard-coded until I get the activity for creating  playlists working.</li>
						<li>Introduced code to handle errors when trying to play a song from the phone.  The grid is colored red to highlight the error
							and a new song is chosen to play, according to the current grid play setting.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<p><br/><br/>TODO<br/></p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>In single play mode, if a user selects a grid, we skip that grid if all songs from it have already been played, perhaps we
							should reset all songs to not played in this case and then choose a random one?</li>
						<li>New feature - play all songs on a grid, in random order</li>
						<li>Automatically start playing music when a grid is clicked on if music is not already playing, and player is not paused</li>
						<li>Tap a green grid again to deselect it as the next grid to play</li>
						<li>Investigate code for getting album art from the music file</li>
						<li>See if I want to support skip-rewind</li>
						<li>Build activity to create a Grid</li>
						<li>See how to save and load Grids on device</li>
						<li>Go through the guide I found for building Android Audio Players</li>
						<li>Go back and retry supporting different grid sizes</li>
